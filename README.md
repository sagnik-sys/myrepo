A civic issue resolve platform

# 🏙️ Crowdsourced Civic Issue Reporting and Resolution System  

A mobile-first and web-based platform for **citizens to report civic issues** (like potholes, garbage, streetlights) in real-time, and for **municipal staff to manage, track, and resolve** these issues effectively.  

This project bridges the gap between citizens and government authorities by providing transparency, accountability, and real-time notifications.
